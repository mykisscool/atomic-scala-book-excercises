#### Atomic Scala book exercises

Just my going through all of the exercises in Bruce Eckel's [Atomic Scala book](https://gumroad.com/l/AtomicScala) in a mildly unorganized manner. If you want to be a Scala schola(r), you have to start somewhere.

_I skipped "Summary 1", "Summary 2", and "Idiomatic Scala"_
